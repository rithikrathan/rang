p5 is a Python library that provides high level drawing functionality
to help you quickly create simulations and interactive art using
Python. It combines the core ideas of `Processing
<https://processing.org/>`_ — learning to code in a visual context —
with Python's readability to make programming more accessible to
beginners, educators, and artists.

To report a bug / make a feature request use the `issues page <https://github.com/p5py/p5/issues>`_ in this repository. You can also use the `discourse platform
<https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5py/27>`_  to ask/discuss anything related to p5py. 

Example
-------

p5 programs are called "sketches" and are run as any other Python
program. The sketch above, for instance, draws a circle at the mouse
location that gets a random reddish color when the mouse is pressed
and is white otherwise; the size of the circle is chosen randomly. The
Python code for the sketch looks like:

.. code:: python

   from p5 import *

   def setup():
       size(640, 360)
       no_stroke()
       background(204)

   def draw():
       if mouse_is_pressed:
           fill(random_uniform(255), random_uniform(127), random_uniform(51), 127)
       else:
           fill(255, 15)

       circle_size = random_uniform(low=10, high=80)

       circle((mouse_x, mouse_y), circle_size)

   def key_pressed(event):
       background(204)
       
   # p5 supports different backends to render sketches, 
   # "vispy" for both 2D and 3D sketches & "skia" for 2D sketches
   # use "skia" for better 2D experience 
   # Default renderer is set to "vispy"
   run(renderer="vispy") # "skia" is still in beta
